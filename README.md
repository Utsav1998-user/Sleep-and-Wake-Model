😴 Sleep & Awake Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model built in Google Colab to predict whether a person is in a sleeping or awake state based on given features. It demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and classification using Python ML libraries.

🚀 Features

● Classifies state as Sleep 💤 or Awake 🌞.

● Built and trained in Google Colab.

● Uses data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

● Easy to run with Colab GPU/TPU support.

📂 Dataset

● Source: Kaggle / Google

● Example features may include:

● Sleep/Awake (target variable)

⚙️ Tech Stack

● Python (Google Colab)

● NumPy, Pandas → Data preprocessing

● Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization

● Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch → Model building & training

📖 Workflow

● Load and preprocess dataset in Colab.

● Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

● Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Network).

● Evaluate model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

● Predict sleep/awake state for new data.

🎯 Applications

Useful in health monitoring systems.

Can be integrated into wearables & smart devices.

Great beginner project to understand classification models in ML.
